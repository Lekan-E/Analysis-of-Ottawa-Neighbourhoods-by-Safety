# Analysis of Ottawa Neighbourhoods by Safety using KMeans


## Introduction
Ottawa consistently ranks as one of Canadaâ€™s safest cities, but some areas offer a quieter and statistically safer environment within the city limits. Whether as a new immigrant, a young family, or someone who prioritizes security, a vital question to answer is "What Neighbourhood/Ward is safe and which do I settle in?". The aim of this project analyze all 23 Ottawa wards to group and rank them from the safest to dangerous using Machine Learning and Data Visualization techniques. I performed analysis using the following criteria:
- Primary Benchmarks considered were Auto Theft, Bike Theft, Criminal Offences (Theft, Assaults, Break and Enter etc), Hate Crime, Homicide and Shootings in each Ward from 2018-2023.
